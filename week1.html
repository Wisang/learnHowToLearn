		<h2>Two ways: fucus and diffuse</h2>

		When learning new things: go back and forth between fucus mode and diffuse mode

		grow neural like muscles: make neural grow a little everyday
	</p>

	<p>
		<h3>1. Procrastination</h3>
		- why?: get nervous to start something<br>
		- How to avoid?: Pomodoro
		<ul>
			<li>25 minutes</li>
			<li>no interruption</li>
			<li>focus</li>
			<li>reward</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>2. Practice makes permanent</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>first solving: make loose synapse</li>
			<li>second try without looking at the solution: make synapse stronger</li>
			<li>repeat: make a strong pattern in nueral network</li>
			<li>how?: practice and stop and relax with Pomodoro</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>3. Memory</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>short term memory: working memory, 전두엽에 위치, has four chunks</li>
			<li>long term memory: occupies large space in brain. can store billions of things. need to visit often to use effectively</li>
			<li>when faced with new things: working memory is used. to move it to long-term memory, it takes practice and repeat</li>
			<li>how?: spaced repetition: practice once a day. it takes time for mortar to be concrete. it takes time for synaptic connection concrete</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>4. Sleep</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>brain cells shink during sleep, which makes the space between celles bigger so that toxic material pass faster and your brain becomes better</li>
			<li>makes your brain reorganize the information to harden your knowledge</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Interview</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>new neurons are generated when you are surrounded by people and stimulate each other</li>
			<li>newe neurons are generated when exercise also. And taking a break or doing exercise make the neuron network more concrete</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Posting from a student</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One can't concentrate, read, focus and keep things in memory when in depression/anxiety/trauma/PTSD</li>
			<li>Procrastination makes depression and anxiety even worse</li>
		</ul>
