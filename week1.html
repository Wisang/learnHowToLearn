		<h2>Two ways: fucus and diffuse</h2>

		When learning new things: go back and forth between fucus mode and diffuse mode

		grow neural like muscles: make neural grow a little everyday
	</p>

	<p>
		<h3>1. Procrastination</h3>
		- why?: get nervous to start something<br>
		- How to avoid?: Pomodoro
		<ul>
			<li>25 minutes</li>
			<li>no interruption</li>
			<li>focus</li>
			<li>reward</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>2. Practice makes permanent</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>first solving: make loose synapse</li>
			<li>second try without looking at the solution: make synapse stronger</li>
			<li>repeat: make a strong pattern in nueral network</li>
			<li>how?: practice and stop and relax with Pomodoro</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>3. Memory</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>short term memory: working memory, 전두엽에 위치, has four chunks</li>
			<li>long term memory: occupies large space in brain. can store billions of things. need to visit often to use effectively</li>
			<li>when faced with new things: working memory is used. to move it to long-term memory, it takes practice and repeat</li>
			<li>how?: spaced repetition: practice once a day. it takes time for mortar to be concrete. it takes time for synaptic connection concrete</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>4. Sleep</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>brain cells shink during sleep, which makes the space between celles bigger so that toxic material pass faster and your brain becomes better</li>
			<li>makes your brain reorganize the information to harden your knowledge</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Interview</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>new neurons are generated when you are surrounded by people and stimulate each other</li>
			<li>newe neurons are generated when exercise also. And taking a break or doing exercise make the neuron network more concrete</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Posting from a student</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One can't concentrate, read, focus and keep things in memory when in depression/anxiety/trauma/PTSD</li>
			<li>Procrastination makes depression and anxiety even worse</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>chunk</h3>
			chunk is a network of neurons to accomplish some work<br>
			how to form a chunk?
		<ol>
			<li>focused attention, otherwise the network is hard to be formed</li>
			<li>understand the basics. fiture out the main idea by going back and forth between focused mode and diffuse mode. But looking at the solution does not make the neural pattern. After seeing it, close the book and do it by yourself. Doing things by yourself can make a chunk.</li>
			<li>practice with a context. notice when to use the chunk and when not to. In that way you can understand the big picture</li>
		</ol>
			chunking, the essentials
		<ul>
			<li>re-reading is not effective, recall. close the book and try to repharase what you learned. practice and recall makes the chunk permanent.</li>
			<li>avoid illusion of competence. you read something and assume that you have that in your brain. It's not true.</li>
			<li>how to avoid illusion of competence: test or recall the material. doing it in different place like outside is even better</li>
			<li>making mistakes is good for making the chunk concrete</li>
		</ul>
