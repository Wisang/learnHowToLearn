Two ways: fucus and diffuse

When learning new things: go back and forth between fucus mode and diffuse mode

grow neural like muscles: make neural grow a little everyday

1. Procrastination
 - why?: get nervous to start something
 - How to avoid?: Pomodoro
	.25 minutes
	.no interruption
	.focus
	.reward

2. Practice makes permanent
 - first solving: make loose synapse
 - second try without looking at the solution: make synapse stronger
 - repeat: make a strong pattern in nueral network
 - how?: practice and stop and relax with Pomodoro

3. Memory
 - short term memory: working memory, 전두엽에 위치, has four chunks
 - long term memory: occupies large space in brain. can store billions of things. need to visit often to use effectively.
 - when faced with new things: working memory is used. to move it to long-term memory, it takes practice and repeat
 - how?: spaced repetition: practice once a day. it takes time for mortar to be concrete. it takes time for synaptic connection concrete.
