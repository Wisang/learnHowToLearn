	<h3>chunk</h3>
	chunk is a network of neurons to accomplish some work<br>
	how to form a chunk?
	<ol>
		<li>focused attention, otherwise the network is hard to be formed</li>
		<li>understand the basics. fiture out the main idea by going back and forth between focused mode and diffuse mode. But looking at the solution does not make the neural pattern. After seeing it, close the book and do it by yourself. Doing things by yourself can make a chunk.</li>
		<li>practice with a context. notice when to use the chunk and when not to. In that way you can understand the big picture</li>
	</ol>
	chunking, the essentials
	<ul>
		<li>re-reading is not effective, recall. close the book and try to repharase what you learned. practice and recall makes the chunk permanent.</li>
		<li>avoid illusion of competence. you read something and assume that you have that in your brain. It's not true.</li>
		<li>how to avoid illusion of competence: test or recall the material. doing it in different place like outside is even better</li>
		<li>making mistakes is good for making the chunk concrete</li>
	</ul>
