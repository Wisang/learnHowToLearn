	<h3>chunk</h3>
	chunk is a network of neurons to accomplish some work<br>
	how to form a chunk?
	<ol>
		<li>focused attention, otherwise the network is hard to be formed</li>
		<li>understand the basics. fiture out the main idea by going back and forth between focused mode and diffuse mode. But looking at the solution does not make the neural pattern. After seeing it, close the book and do it by yourself. Doing things by yourself can make a chunk.</li>
		<li>practice with a context. notice when to use the chunk and when not to. In that way you can understand the big picture</li>
	</ol>
	chunking, the essentials
	<ul>
		<li>re-reading is not effective, recall. close the book and try to repharase what you learned. practice and recall makes the chunk permanent.</li>
		<li>avoid illusion of competence. you read something and assume that you have that in your brain. It's not true.</li>
		<li>how to avoid illusion of competence: test or recall the material. doing it in different place like outside is even better</li>
		<li>making mistakes is good for making the chunk concrete</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Motivation</h3>
	Hormons and motivation
	<ul>
		<li>Dopamine is produced when we have unexpected reward, not only immeditae but also future rewards. Drug fools you to expecte that something wonderful will happen, which actually the opposite. Lack of Dopamine leads to lack of motivation. Severe lack of Dopamine leads to Pakinson. Dopamine belongs to the unconscious part. Promising reward after study brings you to Dopamine region.</li>
		<li>Seronotine affects the social life.</li>
		<li>Emotion has close realtionship with cognition and affects learning and memory. To keep the good learning capability, you need to keep staying happy</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Seeing the big picture</h3>
	Recall what you tried in school to learn something. You tried to find the similar things you learned in the past to the new things. It generates new neuron patterns and make them concrete.
	<ul>
		<li>Chunks are like libraries. You can use them to do and learn new things. If you have many solid libraries, you can solve problems easily. Diffuse mode leads the chunks to network with other chunks.</li>
		<li>Two ways of problem solving
			<ul>
				<li>Sequential resoning: involved with focused mode</li>
				<li>Holistic(Global) intuition: semi-random connection to new things. It should be verified later with focused mode thinking. Intuition is not always correct.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Law of Serendipity: Too many concepts and don't know how to learn them all. Then recall Serendipity. Lady luck favors the one who tries. Make chunk for the first concept, then the second will follow easily.</li> 
	</ul>
